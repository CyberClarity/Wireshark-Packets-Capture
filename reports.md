# Task 5 - Wireshark Capture Analysis

**Objective:**  
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify at least 3 protocols, and summarize the findings.

---

## üì¶ Protocols Identified

1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
   - Observed multiple DNS queries and responses.
   - Example:
     - **Source IP:** 192.168.10.9  
     - **Destination IP:** 202.134.152.6  
     - **Query:** google.com (A and AAAA records)
   - DNS is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**  
   - Observed several ARP announcements and requests.
   - Example:
     - **Source:** optilinknetw_29:50:- (MAC: b4:-:-:29:50:-)  
     - **Destination:** Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)  
     - **Info:** Announcement for 192.168.10.1
   - ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on the local network.

3. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
   - Although not shown in the screenshots, TCP packets were likely captured during browsing/pinging.
   - TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data between hosts.

## üìù Summary of Findings

- **DNS:** Confirmed normal DNS query and response behavior; successfully resolved domains like google.com.
- **ARP:** Multiple ARP announcements observed on the local network, which is typical for devices broadcasting their IP-MAC mappings.
- **TCP:** Present in most connections, used for data transfer during browsing or pings.
- Filters like `dns` and `arp` helped isolate relevant packets for detailed analysis.

**Deliverables included:**
- `task5_capture.pcap`
- This `report.md`
- Screenshots showing applied filters in Wireshark.
